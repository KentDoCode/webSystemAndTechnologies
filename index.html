        <h1>My Autobiography</h1>
        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am Kent Villalun, a simple yet passionate student from Puro, Magsingal, Ilocos Sur. This is a glimpse into my life, from where did all started, what are my learnings so far, and what are my goals or things I want to achieved.</p>

        <section id="early-life">
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>I was born on November 3, 2005 at Bantay, Ilocos Sur. I was raised by a family that is full of love and always supportive in things that I want. I never dreams of becoming a programmer, or anything related to IT. As a child, I always wanted to be like a policeman, an engineer, or a doctor. But as growing up, experienced technology, my interest changed, and now, I wanted to be a developer, to make my own games, websites, and applications</p>

        <section id="hobbies-interests">
            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>I love playing video games, especially those immersive graphics and good storyline. I also enjoyed learning on my own, like web development. I am currently familiarizing myself with CSS and soon to start Javascript. Sometimes, I also play the guitar for fun, because I am not good at it.</p>

        <section id="life-challenges">
            <h2>Life Challenges</h2>
            <p>There are times of burnout, especially when acads, problems, and other responsibilities all come at the same time. But what's important is that I am learning, I learned how to take a break, and trusting that everything is happening for a reason.</p>

        <section id="dreams-goals">
            <h2 style="font-family: verdana;">Dreams and Goals</h2>
            <p>My end goal is to become a software engineer, and maybe work abroad someday or even start my own tech company. I want to help and provide for my family and be able to pay back their sacrifices.</p>

            <p>
                Life is a journey, and I'm still in the beginning of mine. But one thing I know is for sure, I'll keep on learning, keep on moving forward, and keep on chasing my goals in life. If there is anything I want you to remember from me. That is no matter how hard life is. You must always keep on thriving, keep on moving forward because it's worth it.
